            <h5>
                Learning a new language involves listening, speaking, reading, writing, sometimes even a new alphabet and writing format. ... Instead, what you need is a balanced study plan: a mix of study activities that target both spoken and written language, and gives attention to all three key principles.

                <b>English:</b>
                <br />
                I think that the best way to improve your language is to put it on practice, use what we know, we don't need to know everything, also it is important to learn new vocabulary and expressions. It has been difficult to find an English partner who help me to practice my English. Sometimes it happen just to hold a short conversation for one day and that's all.

                <b>Spanish:</b>
                <br />
                Well, learning to speak Spanish, is a good idea for a handful of reasons: you can increase your chances of being able to work from anywhere in the world, more easily meet and date folks in countries where most people donâ€™t speak your native language and maybe even get to travel the world for free.
                Each language comes with its own pros and cons. Some, like English, are spoken widely throughout the world, making it incredibly beneficial. Others, like Paakantyi, are only still spoken by a handful of people, but allow learners to be one of the sole speakers maintaining its existence.F

                <b>Chinese:</b>
                <br />
                Some believe that learning Chinese is one of the best investments you can make. That may sound hyperbolic but the numbers do back it up.
                China is one of the fastest growing economies in the last 2 decades. It's shaping entertainment, business, and even politics around the world. While there are many English speakers living in China and other Mandarin speaking countries, you'll find more people that do not. Besides, even if one speaks a language, there's no sweeter sound than hearing your native tongue.
